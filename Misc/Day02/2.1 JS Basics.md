# 2.1 JS Basics [ 03/09/2025 ]

## let (vs) var (vs) const

- If we declare a variable using
    - const → re-assignment & re-declaration are NOT Possible && Must be initialized
    - let → re-assignment is Possible BUT re-declaration is NOT Possible [ Use this ]
    - var → Both re-assignment & re-declaration are Possible [ Old Syntax ]

| Keyword | Scope | Re-Assignable | Re-Declarable | Hoisted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `var` | Function | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes [ Weirdly ] |
| `let` | Block | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `const` | Block | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

## Higher Order Functions

`Higher Order Function` → A function that does either

- takes one (or) multiple functions as arguments
- returns a function

Simply, A function which takes another function as argument ( or ) returns another function

## Callbacks

- **`callbacks`** are functions passed as arguments so as to be executed later
- Callbacks are Used to Handle **asynchronous Operations (API calls, timers, file reads, etc.)** in a non-blocking manner
- Problem → Callbacks Can lead to “callback hell” [ Nested Callbacks ]
    - Solution → Hence, use Promises, async/await to solve

## Methods

- Functions that are associated with an Object are called Methods
- Methods → Actions that can be performed on an object

## Data Types

- We have data in the form of text, true/false, numbers [int & decimal ] & so on..
- That means data which needs to be stored in a variable is of many forms
    - Hence, this data is been segregated into multiple types called “Data Types”
- Data Types in JS are:
    - number
    - string
    - Boolean
    - null
    - undefined
    - bigint
    - symbol

## null ( vs ) undefined

- null → **intentional absence of a value( or ) assignment** that represents **"no value"** or **"empty"**
- undefined → **absence of a value** due to **lack of initialization**

## Normal function ( vs ) Arrow Function

| Feature | Normal Function | Arrow Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | Verbose | Shorter & Concise |
| `this` binding | Has its **own `this`** context.
`this` depends on **how function is called ]** | **Does not have its own `this`**.
Inherits `this` from the **enclosing lexical scope**. [ Parent ] |
| `arguments` object | Available | Not available |
| Used as constructor | Yes | No |
| Suitable for methods | Yes | No |

## `forEach()`

- **Purpose:** Loops through each item in an array.
- **Return:** Nothing (`undefined`).
- **Use case:** Perform side effects (like logging or modifying external variables).

```jsx
[1, 2, 3].forEach(x => console.log(x));
// Logs: 1, 2, 3
```

## `map()`

- **Purpose:** Transforms each item in an array.
- **Return:** A **new array** with the transformed values.
- **Use case:** When you want to **modify data**.

```jsx
const doubled = [1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2);
// [2, 4, 6]
```

## `filter()`

- **Purpose:** Filters items based on a condition.
- **Return:** A **new array** with items that pass the test.
- **Use case:** When you want to **remove unwanted items**.

```jsx
const evens = [1, 2, 3, 4].filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
// [2, 4]
```

## `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`

- `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` are used to **set the `this` value** inside a function (i.e., control the context in which a function runs).
- `call()`
    - **Syntax**: `func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
        - **Temporarily binds/sets the value of `this` & Executes immediately**
        - **Arguments passed individually**
- `apply()`
    - **Syntax**: `func.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])`
        - **Temporarily binds/sets the value of `this` & Executes immediately**
        - **Arguments passed as an array**
- `bind()`
    - **Syntax**: `const boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
        - **Fixes the Value of `this` & Returns it as a new function**
        - **Does NOT execute immediately**

```jsx
function greet(a, b) {
  console.log(`I'm ${this.name} , I'm ${this.age} yeras old, ${a}, ${b}`);
}

const person = { name: 'Paris', age: 20 };

greet.call(person, 5, 10); // Output: I'm Paris, I'm 20 years old, 5, 10
greet.apply(person, [5, 10]); // Output: I'm Paris, I'm 20 years old, 5, 10

const greetSiva = greet.bind(person, 5, 10);
greetSiva(); // Output: I'm Paris, I'm 20 years old, 5, 10
```

| Method | Invokes Immediately? | Accepts Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `call` | ✅ Yes | Comma-separated | Calls with custom `this` |
| `apply` | ✅ Yes | Array | Like `call`, but with array of args |
| `bind` | ❌ No | Comma-separated | Returns new function with bound `this` |
